# Plan: debtor-chasing-build-standard

The technical strategy is yours. The standard names roles, never vendors, so
this plan starts from what the repository already runs.

## Roles this standard needs

- **record** (Somewhere the book lives): Durable storage that the workflow owns the write path to, keyed so the same record can be found twice.
- **schedule** (Something that runs it on time): A trigger that fires on a cadence and can call an authenticated endpoint.
- **surface** (Something a person opens): A view of the book that whoever does this job can read and act on without asking a developer.
- **call** (The live phone call): An Australian number that discloses it is not a person, respects the Do Not Call Register and that state's calling hours, and keeps a record that survives a dispute. — the live step; never yours

## Work out what already fills them

1. Fetch the substrate registry named in checks.json and match `providers[].detect` against this repository.
2. Union what matched. That is what you have.
3. Build the difference and nothing else.

## Surface

Start at tier 0: a scheduled email carrying the list. Build a page only when
somebody needs to look at the book mid-day.

## Provider

Stub only (`node run.mjs`). No production run is offered for this standard yet:
its live port map is not published. Enable Get Paid on Office Voice / Recover; npx @aipathway/conformance connect gets the owner a key and the links to connect their systems. There is no production run of these checks yet: AIPATHWAY_PROVIDER=office_voice.recover needs a live port map that is not published, so the stub run is the finished build. Do not hand-roll the live step.
Run `npx @aipathway/conformance show debtor-chasing-build-standard` for the check list.
